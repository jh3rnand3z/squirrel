# squirrel monkey
They have a number of vocal calls, including warning sounds to protect themselves from large falcons, which are a natural threat to them. Their small body size also makes them susceptible to predators such as snakes and felids. They live together in multi-male/multi-female groups with up to 500 members. These large groups can, however occasionally break into smaller troops.
